# Homework-2
The objective of this homework is to give you practice using make files to compose an executable file
from a set of source files and adding additional functions to an existing set of code. This assignment will
give you an appreciation for the ease with which well designed software can be extended.
 For this assignment, you will use both the static and dynamic assignment versions of the matrix
software. Using each version, do the following:
1. Develop a module which calculates the transpose of a matrix. Your module should return a matrix
with the elements interchanged so that A_out[i][j] = A_in[j][i]. (You should be able to use the same
module for both the static and dynamic versions.) While developing and testing the software that
implements the transpose function, you may wish to use the Netbeans IDE to do so.
2. Generate a makefile that you can use to compile the set of modules to generate the executable file.
3. Modify the set of software so that the matrix elements are now integers, rather than a double
precision float value.
4. Execute your transpose file with both the static and dynamic implementation and the version with
integer elements. Copy the outputs to a text file to demonstrate proper execution
